# Fullstack Development Challenge 6

## Welcome to the sixth Challenge of the UCLA Bootcamp!

In this challenge we were supposed to rework a starter code so that it would show a daily work planner in which you could set notes for each time slot. Depending on the time, each time slot would show a color for a "past", "present", and "future" state, corresponding with grey, red, and green. To start, we should follow our user story on what we want to solve:

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## The Completed Challenge

After completing the challenge, we should now have a planner that matches the tab colors with the current time, shows the current day at the top, and allows you to save notes to your localStorage so that when you refresh, it will stay saved.
